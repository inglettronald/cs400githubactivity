Alright, I can do this. There is a clear mark where the rug laid in the entryway as I roll it up. This will be hard to explain to the wife. 
	“Sorry dude,” I say standing over the body like he can still hear me. Rolling him up in the rug, I heave it over my shoulder. Lighter than I thought. Tears stream down my face. You got this Charles. You are a man. You do what you have to do. My pep talk is enough. I flick the porchlight on as the sliding door glides open and I step outside into the early morning. The neighbor’s porch lights up too. 

I briefley panicked, dropping the body. His head made an astounding thump on the porch board. I looked over, and there was nobody there. It must have been the motion sensors. Quickly picking the body back up, I started to drag it around to the fenced off portion of the back yard...
